- Suggest an improvement or correct an error by [raising an Issue](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-shell/issues).
- Run a workshop at your own institution! If you do, alert us on [TopicBox](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss-library-carpentry) or [Slack](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/): we're happy to help promote the workshop and offer guidance on running it. Remember, there is no better way to deepen your own knowledge of software skills than to teach others.

You will also need to download the file **[shell-lesson.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librarycarpentry/lc-shell/gh-pages/data/shell-lesson.zip)** from GitHub to your *desktop* and extract it there (once you have unzipped/extracted the file, you should end up with a folder called "shell-lesson").

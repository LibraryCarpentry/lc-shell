This Library Carpentry lesson introduces librarians to the Unix Shell.
At the conclusion of the lesson you will: understand the basics of the Unix shell;
understand why and how to use the command line;
use shell commands to work with directories and files;
use shell commands to find and manipulate data.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> To complete this lesson, you will need a UNIX-like shell environment -see [Setup](http://data-lessons.github.io/library-shell/setup/). You will also need to download the file **[shell-lesson.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/data-lessons/library-shell/gh-pages/data/shell-lesson.zip)** from GitHub to your *desktop* and extract it there (once you have unzipped/extracted the file, you should end up with a folder called "shell-lesson").

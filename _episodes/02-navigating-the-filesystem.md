## Navigating the shell

We will begin with the basics of navigating the Unix shell.

Let's start by opening the shell. This likely results in seeing a black or white window with a cursor flashing next to a dollar sign.
This is our command line, and the `$` is the command **prompt** to show that the system is ready for our input.
The appearance of the prompt will vary from system to system, depending on how the set up has been configured.
Other common prompts include the `%` or `#` signs, but we will use `$` in this lesson to represent the prompt generally.

When working in the shell, you are always *somewhere* in the computer's
file system, in some folder (directory). We will therefore start by finding out
where we are by using the `pwd` command, which you can use whenever you are unsure
about where you are. It stands for "print working directory" and the result of the
command is printed to your standard output, which is the screen.

Let's type `pwd` and hit enter to execute the command
(Note that the `$` sign is used to indicate a command to be typed on the command prompt,
 but we never type the `$` sign itself, just what follows after it.):

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
/Users/riley
~~~
{: .output}

The output will be a path to your home directory. Let's check if we recognise it
by looking at the contents of the directory. To do that, we use the `ls` command. This stands for "list" and the result is a print out of all the contents in the directory:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
Applications Documents    Library      Music        Public
Desktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures
~~~
{: .output}

We may want more information than just a list of files and directories.
We can get this by specifying various **flags** (also known as `options`, `parameters`, or, most frequently,
`arguments`) to go with our basic commands.
Arguments modify the workings of the command by telling the computer what sort of output or manipulation we want.

If we type `ls -l` and hit enter, the computer returns a list of files that contains
information similar to what we would find in our Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows):
the size of the files in bytes, the date it was created or last modified, and the file name.

~~~
$ ls -l
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~

{: .output}

In everyday usage we are more used to units of measurement like kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes.
Luckily, there's another flag `-h` that when used with the -l option, use unit suffixes:
Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the
number of digits to three or less using base 2 for sizes.

Now `ls -h` won't work on its own. When we want to combine two flags,
we can just run them together. So, by typing `ls -lh` and hitting
enter we receive an output in a human-readable format (note: the order here doesn't matter).

~~~
$ ls -lh
~~~
{: .bash}

{: .output}

We've now spent a great deal of time in our home directory.
Let's go somewhere else. We can do that through the `cd` or Change Directory command:
(Note: On Windows and Mac, by default, the case of the file/directory doesn't matter
On Linux it does.)

~~~
$ cd Desktop
~~~
{: .bash}

Notice that the command didn't output anything. This means that it was carried
out successfully. Let's check by using `pwd`:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
/Users/riley/Desktop
~~~
{: .output}

If something had gone wrong, however, the command would have told you. Let's
test that by trying to move into a non-existent directory:

~~~
$ cd "things to learn about the shell"
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
bash: cd: things to learn about the shell: No such file or directory
~~~
{: .output}

Notice that we surrounded the name by quotation marks. The *arguments* given
to any shell command are separated by spaces, so a way to let them know that
we mean 'one single thing called "things to learn about the shell"', not
'six different things', is to use (single or double) quotation marks.

We've now seen how we can go 'down' through our directory structure
(as in into more nested directories). If we want to go back, we can type `cd ..`.
This moves us 'up' one directory, putting us back where we started.
**If we ever get completely lost, the command `cd` without any arguments will bring
us right back to the home directory, the place where we started.**

Being able to navigate the file system is very important for using the Unix shell effectively.
As we become more comfortable, we can get very quickly to the directory that we want.

> ## Getting help
>
> Use the `man` command to invoke the manual page (documentation) for a shell command.
> For example, `man ls` displays all the arguments available to you - which saves
> you remembering them all! Try this for each command you've learned so far.
> Use the <kbd>spacebar</kbd> to navigate the manual pages. Use <kbd>q</kbd> at any time to quit.
>
> ***Note*: this command is for Mac and Linux users only**. It does not work directly for Windows users.
> If you use Windows, you can search for the shell command on [http://man.he.net/](http://man.he.net/),
> and view the associated manual page. In some systems the command name followed by `--help` will work, e.g. `ls --help`.
>
> Also, the manual lists commands individually, e.g., although `-h` can only be used together with the `-l` option,
> you'll find it listed as `-h` in the manual, not as `-lh`.

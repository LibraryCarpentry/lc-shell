##  Counting and mining data

Now that you know how to navigate the shell, we will move onto
learning how to count and mine data using a few of the standard shell commands.
While these commands are unlikely to revolutionize your work by themselves,
they're very versatile and will add to your foundation for working in the shell
and for learning to code. The commands also replicate the sorts of uses library users might make of library data.

## Counting and sorting

We will begin by counting the contents of files using the Unix shell.
We can use the Unix shell to quickly generate counts from across files,
something that is tricky to achieve using the graphical user interfaces of standard office suites.

Let's start by navigating to the directory that contains our data using the
`cd` command:

~~~
$ cd shell-lesson
~~~
{: .bash}

Remember, if at any time you are not sure where you are in your directory structure,
use the `pwd` command to find out:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
/Users/riley/Desktop/shell-lesson
~~~
{: .output}

And let's just check what files are in the directory and how large they
are with `ls -lhS`:

~~~
$ ls -lhS
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
total 139M
-rw-rw-r-- 1 riley staff 126M Jun 10  2015 2014-01_JA.tsv
-rw-r--r-- 1 riley staff 7.4M Jan 31 18:47 2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv
-rw-r--r-- 1 riley staff 3.6M Jan 31 18:47 2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv
-rw-r--r-- 1 riley staff 1.4M Jan 31 18:47 2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv

In this episode we'll focus on the dataset `2014-01_JA.tsv`, that contains
journal article metadata, and the three `.tsv` files derived from the original
dataset. Each of these three `.tsv` files includes all data where a keyword such
as `africa` or `america` appears in the 'Title' field of `2014-01_JA.tsv`.

> ## CSV and TSV Files
> CSV (Comma-separated values) is a common plain text format for storing tabular
> data, where each record occupies one line and the values are separated by commas.
> TSV (Tab-separated values) is just the same except that values are separated by
> tabs rather than commas. Confusingly, CSV is sometimes used to refer to both CSV,
> TSV and variations of them. The simplicity of the formats make them great for
> exchange and archival. They are not bound to a specific program (unlike Excel
> files, say, there is no `CSV` program, just lots and lots of programs that
> support the format, including Excel by the way.), and you wouldn't have any
> problems opening a 40 year old file today if you came across one.

<!-- hm, reminds me of MARC -->

First, let's have a look at the largest data file, using the tools we learned in
[Reading files]({{ page.root }}/03-working-with-files-and-folders/#reading-files):

~~~
$ cat 2014-01_JA.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}

Like `829-0.txt` before, the whole dataset cascades by and can't really make any
sense of that amount of text. To cancel this on-going con`cat`enation, or indeed any
process in the Unix shell, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

In most data files a quick glimpse of the first few lines already tells us a lot
about the structure of the dataset, for example the table/column headers:

~~~
$ head -n 3 2014-01_JA.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~

In the header, we can see the common metadata fields of academic papers: `Creator`, `Issue`, `Citation`, etc.

Next, let's learn about a basic data analysis tool:
`wc` is the "word count" command: it counts the number of lines, words, and bytes.
Since we love the wildcard operator, let's run the command
`wc *.tsv` to get counts for all the `.tsv` files in the current directory
(it takes a little time to complete):

~~~~
$ wc *.tsv
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
    13712    511261   3773660 2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv
    27392   1049601   7731914 2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv
   507732  17606310 131122144 2014-01_JA.tsv
     5375    196999   1453418 2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv
   554211  19364171 144081136 total
~~~
{: .output}

The first three columns contains the number of lines, words and bytes.

If we only have a handful of files to compare, it might be faster or more convenient
to just check with Microsoft Excel, OpenRefine or your favorite text editor, but
when we have tens, hundreds or thousands of documents, the Unix shell has a clear
speed advantage. The real power of the shell comes from being able to combine commands
and automate tasks, though. We will touch upon this slightly.

For now, we'll see how we can build a simple pipeline to find the shortest file
in terms of number of lines. We start by adding the `-l` flag to get only the
number of lines, not the number of words and bytes:

~~~~
$ wc -l *.tsv
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
    13712 2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv
    27392 2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv
   507732 2014-01_JA.tsv
     5375 2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv
   554211 total
~~~
{: .output}

The `wc` command itself doesn't have a flag to sort the output, but as we'll
see, we can combine three different shell commands to get what we want.

First, we have the `wc -l *.tsv` command. We will save the output from this
command in a new file. To do that, we *redirect* the output from the command
to a file using the ‘greater than’ sign (>), like so:

~~~
$ wc -l *.tsv > lengths.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

There's no output now since the output went into the file `lengths.txt`, but
we can check that the output indeed ended up in the file using `cat` or `less`
(or Notepad or any text editor).

~~~~
$ cat lengths.txt
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
    13712 2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv
    27392 2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv
   507732 2014-01_JA.tsv
     5375 2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv
   554211 total
~~~
{: .bash}

Next, there is the `sort` command. We'll use the `-n` flag to specify that we
want numerical sorting, not lexical sorting, we output the results into
yet another file, and we use `cat` to check the results:

~~~~
$ sort -n lengths.txt > sorted-lengths.txt
$ cat sorted-lengths.txt
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
     5375 2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv
    13712 2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv
    27392 2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv
   507732 2014-01_JA.tsv
   554211 total
~~~
{: .output}

Finally we have our old friend `head`, that we can use to get the first line
of the `sorted-lengths.txt`:

~~~~
$ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
     5375 2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv
~~~
{: .output}

But we're really just interested in the end result, not the intermediate
results now stored in `lengths.txt` and `sorted-lengths.txt`. What if we could
send the results from the first command (`wc -l *.tsv`) directly to the next
command (`sort -n`) and then the output from that command to `head -n 1`?
Luckily we can, using a concept called pipes. On the command line, you make a
pipe with the vertical bar character `|`. Let's try with one pipe first:

~~~~
$ wc -l *.tsv | sort -n
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
     5375 2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv
    13712 2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv
    27392 2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv
   507732 2014-01_JA.tsv
   554211 total
~~~
{: .output}

Notice that this is exactly the same output that ended up in our `sorted-lengths.txt`
earlier. Let's add another pipe:

~~~~
$ wc -l *.tsv | sort -n | head -n 1
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
     5375 2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv
~~~
{: .output}

It can take some time to fully grasp pipes and use them efficiently, but it's a
very powerful concept that you will find not only in the shell, but also in most
programming languages.

## Mining or searching

Searching for something in one or more files is something we'll often need to do,
so let's introduce a command for doing that: `grep` (short for **global regular
expression print**). As the name suggests, it supports regular expressions and
is therefore only limited by your imagination, the shape of your data, and - when
working with thousands or millions of files - the processing power at your disposal.

To begin using `grep`, first navigate to the `shell-lesson` directory if not already
there. Then create a new directory "results":

~~~
$ mkdir results
~~~
{: .bash}


Now let's try our first search:

~~~
$ grep 1999 *.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}

Remember that the shell will expand `*.tsv` to a list of all the `.tsv` files in the
directory. `grep` will then search these for instances of the string "1999" and
print the matching lines.

> ## Strings
> A string is a sequence of characters, or "a piece of text".
{: .callout}

Press the up arrow once in order to cycle back to your most recent action.
Amend `grep 1999 *.tsv` to `grep -c 1999 *.tsv` and hit enter.

~~~
$ grep -c 1999 *.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv:804
2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv:1478
2014-01_JA.tsv:28767
2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv:284
~~~
{: .output}

The shell now prints the number of times the string 1999 appeared in each file.
If you look at the output from the previous command, this tends to refer to the
date field for each journal article.

We will try another search:

~~~
$ grep -c revolution *.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv:20
2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv:34
2014-01_JA.tsv:867
2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv:9
~~~
{: .output}

We got back the counts of the instances of the string `revolution` within the files.
Now, amend the above command to the below and observe how the output of each is different:

~~~
$ grep -ci revolution *.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv:118
2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv:1018
2014-01_JA.tsv:9327
2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv:122
~~~
{: .output}

This repeats the query, but prints a case
insensitive count (including instances of both `revolution` and `Revolution` and other variants).
Note how the count has increased nearly 30 fold for those journal article
titles that contain the keyword 'america'. As before, cycling back and
adding `> results/`, followed by a filename (ideally in .txt format), will save the results to a data file.

So far we have counted strings in files and printed to the shell or to
file those counts. But the real power of `grep` comes in that you can
also use it to create subsets of tabulated data (or indeed any data)
from one or multiple files.  

~~~
$ grep -i revolution *.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}

This script looks in the defined files and prints any lines containing `revolution`
(without regard to case) to the shell. We let the shell add today's date to the
filename:

~~~
$ grep -i revolution *.tsv > results/$(date "+%Y-%m-%d")_JAi-revolution.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}

This saves the subsetted data to a new file.

> ## Alternative date commands
> This way of writing dates is so common that on some platforms (not macOS X)
> you can get the same result by typing `$(date -I)` instead of
> `$(date "+%Y-%m-%d")`.
{: .callout}

However, if we look at this file, it contains every instance of the
string 'revolution' including as a single word and as part of other words
such as 'revolutionary'. This perhaps isn't as useful as we thought...
Thankfully, the `-w` flag instructs `grep` to look for whole words only,
giving us greater precision in our search.

~~~
$ grep -iw revolution *.tsv > results/$(date "+%Y-%m-%d")_JAiw-revolution.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}

This script looks in both of the defined files and
exports any lines containing the whole word `revolution` (without regard to case)
to the specified `.tsv` file.

We can show the difference between the files we created.

~~~
$ wc -l results/*.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
   10585 2016-07-19_JAi-revolution.tsv
    7779 2016-07-19_JAiw-revolution.tsv
   18364 total

Finally, we'll use the **regular expression syntax** covered earlier to search for similar words.

> ## Basic, extended, and PERL-compatible regular expressions
> There are, unfortunately, [different ways of writing regular expressions](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/html_node/Regular-Expressions.html).

{: .callout}

The regular expression 'fr[ae]nc[eh]' will match "france", "french", but also "frence" and "franch".
It's generally a good idea to enclose the expression in single quotation marks, since
that ensures the shell sends it directly to grep without any processing (such as trying to
expand the wildcard operator *).

~~~
$ grep -iwE 'fr[ae]nc[eh]' *.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}

The shell will print out each matching line.

We include the `-o` flag to print only the matching part of the lines e.g.
(handy for isolating/checking results):

~~~
$ grep -iwEo 'fr[ae]nc[eh]' *.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}

### Using a Loop to Count Words

We will now use a loop to automate the counting of certain words within a document. For this, we will be using the _[Little Women](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/514/pg514.txt)_ e-book from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). The file is inside the `shell-lesson` folder and named `pg514.txt`. Let's rename the file to `littlewomen.txt`.

~~~
$ mv pg514.txt littlewomen.txt
~~~

This renames the file to something easier to type.

Now let's create our loop. In the loop, we will ask the computer to go through the text, looking for each girl's name,
and count the number of times it appears. The results will print to the screen.

~~~
$ for name in "Jo" "Meg" "Beth" "Amy"
> do
>    echo "$name"
>    grep -wo "$name" littlewomen.txt | wc -l
> done
~~~

{: .bash}

~~~
Jo
1355
Meg
683
Beth
459
Amy
645
~~~
{: .output}

What is happening in the loop?  
+ `echo "$name"` is printing the current value of `$name`
+ `grep "$name" littlewomen.txt` finds each line that contains the value stored in `$name`. The `-w` flag finds only the whole word that is the value stored in `$name` and the `-o` flag pulls this value out from the line it is in to give you the actual words to count as lines in themselves.
+ The output from the `grep` command is redirected with the pipe, `|` (without the pipe and the rest of the line, the output from `grep` would print directly to the screen)
+ `wc -l` counts the number of _lines_ (because we used the `-l` flag) sent from `grep`. Because `grep` only returned lines that contained the value stored in `$name`, `wc -l` corresponds to the number of occurrences of each girl's name.

> ## Why are the variables double-quoted here?
>
> a) In [episode 4]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/04-loops.md %}) we learned to

>> ## Solutions
>>
>> a) Because we are explicitly listing the names after `in`,
>> and those contain no white-space. However, for consistency
>> it's better to use rather once too often than once too rarely.
>>
>> b) Without `"`-quoting `$name`, the last loop will try to execute
>> `grep Louisa May Alcott littlewomen.txt`. `grep` interprets only the
>> first word as the search pattern, but `May` and `Alcott` as filenames.
>> This produces two errors and a possibly untrustworthy count:

> ## Selecting columns from our article dataset
> When you receive data it will often contain more columns or variables than you need for your work. If you want to select only the columns you need for your analysis, you can use the `cut` command to do so. `cut` is a tool for extracting sections from a file. For instance, say we want to retain only the `Creator`, `Volume`, `Journal`, and `Citation` columns from our article data. With `cut` we'd:
>~~~
> cut -f 2,4,5,8 2014-01_JA.tsv | head
>~~~
>{: .bash}
>
>~~~
> Creator	Volume	Journal	Citation
> Doolittle, W. E.  59  KIVA -ARIZONA-  KIVA -ARIZONA- 59(1), 7-26. (1993)
> Nelson, M. C.	59	KIVA -ARIZONA-	KIVA -ARIZONA- 59(1), 27-48. (1993)
> Deegan, A. C.	59	KIVA -ARIZONA-	KIVA -ARIZONA- 59(1), 49-64. (1993)
> Stone, T.	59	KIVA -ARIZONA-	KIVA -ARIZONA- 59(1), 65-82. (1993)
> Adams, W. Y.	1	NORTHEAST AFRICAN STUDIES	NORTHEAST AFRICAN STUDIES 1(2/3), 7-18. (1994)
> Beswick, S. F.	1	NORTHEAST AFRICAN STUDIES	NORTHEAST AFRICAN STUDIES 1(2/3), 19-48. (1994)
> Cheeseboro, A. Q.	1	NORTHEAST AFRICAN STUDIES	NORTHEAST AFRICAN STUDIES 1(2/3), 49-74. (1994)
> Duany, W.	1	NORTHEAST AFRICAN STUDIES	NORTHEAST AFRICAN STUDIES 1(2/3), 75-102. (1994)
> Mohamed Ibrahim Khalil	1	NORTHEAST AFRICAN STUDIES	NORTHEAST AFRICAN STUDIES 1(2/3), 103-118. (1994)

> Above we used `cut` and the `-f` flag to indicate which columns we want to retain. `cut` works on tab delimited files by default. We can use the flag `-d` to change this to a comma, or semicolon or another delimiter.
> If you are unsure of your column position and the file has headers on the first line, we can use `head -n 1 <filename>` to print those out.
> ### Now your turn
>Select the columns `Issue`, `Volume`, `Language`, `Publisher` and direct the output into a new file. You can name it something like `2014-01_JA_ivlp.tsv`.
>> ## Solution
>> First, let's see where our desired columns are:
>>
>>~~~
>> head -n 1 2014-01_JA.tsv
>>~~~
>>{: .bash}
>>
>>~~~
>>File	Creator	Issue	Volume	Journal	ISSN	ID	Citation	Title	Place Labe	Language	Publisher	Date
>>~~~
>>{: .output}
>>
>>Ok, now we know `Issue` is column 3, `Volume` 4, `Language` 11, and `Publisher` 12.
>> We use these positional column numbers to construct our `cut` command:
>>```
>> cut -f 3,4,11,12 2014-01_JA.tsv > 2014-01_JA_ivlp.tsv
>>```
>> We can confirm this worked by running head on the file:
>>```
>>head 2014-01_JA_ivlp.tsv
>>```
>>~~~
>>Issue	Volume	Language	Publisher
>>1	59	eng	ARIZONA ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL SOCIETY
>>1	59	eng	ARIZONA ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL SOCIETY

## Working with files and folders

As well as navigating directories, we can interact with files on the command line:
we can read them, open them, run them, and even edit them. In fact, there's really
no limit to what we *can* do in the shell, but even experienced shell users still switch to
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for many tasks, such as editing formatted text
documents (Word or OpenOffice), browsing the web, editing images, etc. But if we
wanted to make the same crop on hundreds of images, say, the pages of a scanned book,
then we could automate that cropping work by using shell commands.

Before getting started, we will use `ls` to verify where we are. Using `ls` periodically
to view your options is useful to orient oneself.

~~~

~~~
{: .output}

We will try a few basic ways to interact with files. Let's first move into the
`shell-lesson` directory on your desktop.
シェルレッスンディレクトリに移動してください。

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
/Users/riley/Desktop/shell-lesson
~~~
{: .output}

Here, we will create a new directory and move into it:

~~~
$ mkdir firstdir
$ cd firstdir
~~~
{: .bash}

Here we used the `mkdir` command (meaning 'make directories') to create a directory
named 'firstdir'. Then we moved into that directory using the `cd` command.

But wait! There's a trick to make things a bit quicker. Let's go up one directory.

~~~
$ cd ..
~~~
{: .bash}

Instead of typing `cd firstdir`, let's try to type `cd f` and then hit the Tab key.
We notice that the shell completes the line to `cd firstdir/`.

> ## Tab for Auto-complete

> Where two or more files have the same characters, the auto-complete will only fill up to the

### Reading files　ファイルを読む

If you are in `firstdir`, use `cd ..` to get back to the `shell-lesson` directory.

{: .output}

The files `829-0.txt` and `33504-0.txt` holds the content of book #829
and #33504 on Project Gutenberg. But we've forgot *which* books, so
we try the `cat` command to read the text of the first file:

~~~
$ cat 829-0.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

The terminal window erupts and the whole book cascades by (it is printed to
your terminal), leaving us with a new prompt and the last few lines of the book
above this prompt.
いきなり動いて本の中身が全部でてきます。

Often we just want a quick glimpse of the first or the last part of a file to
get an idea about what the file is about. To let us do that, the Unix shell
provides us with the commands `head` and `tail`.

This provides a view of the first ten lines,
whereas `tail 829-0.txt` provides a perspective on the last ten lines:

~~~
$ tail 829-0.txt

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to

If ten lines is not enough (or too much), we would check `man head`(or `head --help` when using Windows)
to see if there exists an option to specify the number of lines to get
(there is: `head -n 20` will print 20 lines).

Another way to navigate files is to view the contents one screen at a time.
Type `less 829-0.txt` to see the first screen, `spacebar` to see the
next screen and so on, then `q` to quit (return to the command prompt).

他のコマンドもあります。スペースキー

~~~
$ less 829-0.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

Like many other shell commands, the commands `cat`, `head`, `tail` and `less`
can take any number of arguments (they can work with any number of files).
We will see how we can get the first lines of several files at once.
To save some typing, we introduce a very useful trick first.

Hit the up arrow until you get to the `head 829-0.txt` command. Add a space
and then `33504-0.txt` (Remember your friend Tab? Type `3` followed by Tab to
get `33504-0.txt`), to produce the following command:

All good so far, but if we had *lots* of books, it would be tedious to enter
all the filenames. Luckily the shell supports wildcards! The `?` (matches exactly
one character) and `*` (matches zero or more characters) are probably familiar
from library search systems. We can use the `*` wildcard to write the above `head`
command in a more compact way:

~~~
$ head *.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

> ## More on wildcards
> Wildcards are a feature of the shell and will therefore work with *any* command.
> The shell will expand wildcards to a list of files and/or directories before
> the command is executed, and the command will never see the wildcards.　?は一文字、＊は全部
> As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash
> will pass the expression as a parameter to the command as it is. For example　例外としてワイルドカードがどのファイルにもあたらない場合は直接コマンドに引き渡されます。
> typing `ls *.pdf` results in an error message that there is no file called *.pdf.

### Moving, copying and deleting files

We may also want to change the file name to something more descriptive.
We can **move** it to a new name by using the `mv` or move command,
giving it the old name as the first argument and the new name as the second
argument:
名前を変えたいことがあります。元の名前を一番目の引数に、新しい名前を二番目の引数に指定します。
~~~
$ mv 829-0.txt gulliver.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

This is equivalent to the 'rename file' function.

Afterwards, when we perform a `ls` command, we will see that it is now called `gulliver.txt`:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv   2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv  gulliver.txt
2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv  33504-0.txt

Finally, onto deleting. We won't use it now, but if you do want to delete a file,
for whatever reason, the command is `rm`, or remove.　今日はやりませんが削除はrmというコマンドがあります。rmもワイルドカードをつけることができます。

Using wildcards, we can even delete lots of files. And adding the `-r` flag we　-rをつけるとフォルダを指定することもできます。
can delete folders with all their content.

**Unlike deleting from within our graphical user interface, there is *no* warning,
*no* recycling bin from which you can get the files back and no other undo options!注意もでません。4個以上ファイルを消す場合は警告がでる。ゴミ箱もありません。削除の取り消しはできません。**
For that reason, please be very careful with `rm` and extremely careful with `rm -r`.

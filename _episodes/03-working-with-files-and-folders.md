## Working with files and folders

As well as navigating directories, we can interact with files on the command line:
we can read them, open them, run them, and even edit them. In fact, there's really
no limit to what we *can* do in the shell, but even experienced shell users still switch to
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for many tasks, such as editing formatted text
documents (Word or OpenOffice), browsing the web, editing images, etc. But if we
wanted to make the same crop on hundreds of images, say, the pages of a scanned book,
then we could automate that cropping work by using shell commands.

Before getting started, we will use `ls` to verify where we are. Using `ls` periodically
to view your options is useful to orient oneself. 

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
Applications Documents    Library      Music        Public
Desktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures
~~~
{: .output}

We will try a few basic ways to interact with files. Let's first move into the
`shell-lesson` directory on your desktop.

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
/Users/riley/Desktop/shell-lesson
~~~
{: .output}

Here, we will create a new directory and move into it:

~~~
$ mkdir firstdir
$ cd firstdir
~~~
{: .bash}

Here we used the `mkdir` command (meaning 'make directories') to create a directory
named 'firstdir'. Then we moved into that directory using the `cd` command.

But wait! There's a trick to make things a bit quicker. Let's go up one directory.

~~~
$ cd ..
~~~
{: .bash}

Instead of typing `cd firstdir`, let's try to type `cd f` and then press the Tab key.
We notice that the shell completes the line to `cd firstdir/`.

> ## Tab for Auto-complete
> Pressing tab at any time within the shell will prompt it to attempt to auto-complete
> the line based on the files or sub-directories in the current directory.
> Where two or more files have the same characters, the auto-complete will only fill up to the
> first point of difference, after which we can add more characters, and
> try using tab again. We would encourage using this method throughout
> today to see how it behaves (as it saves loads of time and effort!).

### Reading files

If you are in `firstdir`, use `cd ..` to get back to the `shell-lesson` directory.

Here there are copies of two public domain books downloaded from
[Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) along with other files we will
cover later.

$ ls -lh

{: .output}

The files `829-0.txt` and `33504-0.txt` holds the content of book #829
and #33504 on Project Gutenberg. But we've forgot *which* books, so
we try the `cat` command to read the text of the first file:

~~~
$ cat 829-0.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

The terminal window erupts and the whole book cascades by (it is printed to
your terminal), leaving us with a new prompt and the last few lines of the book
above this prompt.

Often we just want a quick glimpse of the first or the last part of a file to
get an idea about what the file is about. To let us do that, the Unix shell
provides us with the commands `head` and `tail`.

~~~
$ head 829-0.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
{: .output}

This provides a view of the first ten lines,
whereas `tail 829-0.txt` provides a perspective on the last ten lines:

~~~
$ tail 829-0.txt
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

    http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
~~~
{: .output}

If ten lines is not enough (or too much), we would check `man head`(or `head --help` when using Windows)
to see if there exists an option to specify the number of lines to get
(there is: `head -n 20` will print 20 lines).

Another way to navigate files is to view the contents one screen at a time.
Type `less 829-0.txt` to see the first screen, `spacebar` to see the
next screen and so on, then `q` to quit (return to the command prompt).

~~~
$ less 829-0.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

Like many other shell commands, the commands `cat`, `head`, `tail` and `less`
can take any number of arguments (they can work with any number of files).
We will see how we can get the first lines of several files at once.
To save some typing, we introduce a very useful trick first.

> ## Re-using commands
> On a blank command prompt, press the up arrow key and notice that the previous
> command you typed appears before your cursor. We can continue pressing the
> up arrow to cycle through your previous commands. The down arrow cycles back
> toward your most recent command. This is another important labour-saving
> function and something we'll use a lot.
{: .callout}

Press the up arrow until you get to the `head 829-0.txt` command. Add a space
and then `33504-0.txt` (Remember your friend Tab? Type `3` followed by Tab to
get `33504-0.txt`), to produce the following command:

~~~
$ head 829-0.txt 33504-0.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

All good so far, but if we had *lots* of books, it would be tedious to enter
all the filenames. Luckily the shell supports wildcards! The `?` (matches exactly
one character) and `*` (matches zero or more characters) are probably familiar
from library search systems. We can use the `*` wildcard to write the above `head`
command in a more compact way:

~~~
$ head *.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

> ## More on wildcards
> Wildcards are a feature of the shell and will therefore work with *any* command.
> The shell will expand wildcards to a list of files and/or directories before
> the command is executed, and the command will never see the wildcards.
> As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash
> will pass the expression as a parameter to the command as it is. For example
> typing `ls *.pdf` results in an error message that there is no file called *.pdf.

### Moving, copying and deleting files

We may also want to change the file name to something more descriptive.
We can **move** it to a new name by using the `mv` or move command,
giving it the old name as the first argument and the new name as the second
argument:

~~~
$ mv 829-0.txt gulliver.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

This is equivalent to the 'rename file' function.

Afterwards, when we perform a `ls` command, we will see that it is now called `gulliver.txt`:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv   2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv  gulliver.txt
2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv  33504-0.txt
2014-01_JA.tsv

> ## Using `history`

> current session. You can also use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> to do a reverse lookup. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd>,

> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> repeatedly to cycle through them. If you can't find what you're looking for 
> in the reverse lookup, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to return to the prompt. If you want to save 
> your history, maybe to extract some commands from which to build a script later on, you 
> can do that with `history > history.txt`. This will output all history to a text file 
> called `history.txt` that you can later edit. To recall a command from history, enter 
> `history`. Note the command number, e.g. 2045. Recall the command by entering 
> `!2045`. This will execute the command.

> ## Using the `echo` command

> You can also specify a variable. First type `NAME=` followed by your name, and press enter.
> Then type `echo "$NAME is a fantastic library carpentry student"` and press enter. What happens?

> You can combine both text and normal shell commands using `echo`, for example the
> `pwd` command you have learned earlier today. You do this by enclosing a shell
> command in `$(` and `)`, for instance `$(pwd)`. Now, try out the following:
> `echo "Finally, it is nice and sunny on" $(date)`.
> Note that the output of the `date` command is printed together with the text
> you specified. You can try the same with some of the other commands you have learned so far.

Finally, onto deleting. We won't use it now, but if you do want to delete a file,
for whatever reason, the command is `rm`, or remove.

Using wildcards, we can even delete lots of files. And adding the `-r` flag we
can delete folders with all their content.

**Unlike deleting from within our graphical user interface, there is *no* warning,
*no* recycling bin from which you can get the files back and no other undo options!**
For that reason, please be very careful with `rm` and extremely careful with `rm -r`.

## Prerequisites

To complete this lesson, you will need a Unix-like shell environment -see [Setup](learners/setup.md). You will also need to download the file **[shell-lesson.zip](episodes/data/shell-lesson.zip)** from GitHub to your *desktop* and extract it there (once you have unzipped/extracted the file, you should end up with a folder called "shell-lesson").
